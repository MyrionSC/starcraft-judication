Remarks:
Times seem to get higher as the wave gets along
At wave 5 game is visibly slower
without targetdetection the game runs slower than with targetdetection. This may be because the IT are brushing against the cc. But probably not. IDK.
Collision detection takes substantially more performance than targetdetection. Good prospects for implementation of Quad tree :)
